# Anti-Theft-Smart-Flooring-System
Anti-theft flooring systems with Arduino utilize sensors to detect intruders stepping on them, triggering alarms or security measures upon detection.

## Identification of the Problem

The problem that leads to the utilization of anti-theft measures is the risk of theft or unauthorized access to valuable assets, goods, or information. The consequences of theft or unauthorized access can be severe, including financial losses, damage to reputation, and the compromise of sensitive information.

### Business and Organizational Risks

Businesses and organizations often possess valuable assets that are vulnerable to theft or unauthorized access. These assets may include:

- **Cash:** Retail businesses are at risk of theft by shoplifters, while financial institutions, like banks, may face the threat of robbery.
- **Equipment:** Companies may have expensive equipment or machinery that can be targeted by thieves.
- **Merchandise:** Retailers with physical stores must protect their inventory from theft.

In addition to these tangible assets, many organizations handle sensitive information. For example:

- **Healthcare Facilities:** Hospitals and healthcare providers store patient records and medical data that must be safeguarded.
- **Research Institutions:** Research facilities may possess proprietary data or intellectual property.
- **Government Offices:** Government agencies deal with confidential information and documents.

### The Role of Anti-Theft Measures

Anti-theft measures, including innovative solutions like anti-theft flooring systems, play a crucial role in addressing these risks. These measures encompass a range of strategies, such as:

- **Physical Barriers:** Installing locks, gates, safes, and security doors to physically deter unauthorized access.
- **Surveillance Equipment:** Employing cameras, motion sensors, and security personnel to monitor and deter potential thieves.
- **Access Control Systems:** Implementing systems that restrict entry to authorized individuals using key cards, biometrics, or passwords.
- **Alarms:** Deploying alarms and alert systems that notify authorities or security personnel in the event of a breach.

In essence, anti-theft measures are designed to bolster the security of a facility and diminish the likelihood of theft or unauthorized access. They are essential tools for businesses and organizations to maintain financial stability, protect their reputation, and ensure the confidentiality of sensitive information.

By identifying and addressing these security concerns, anti-theft measures not only safeguard assets but also contribute to a safer and more secure environment for employees, customers, and stakeholders.




## Installation

### 1. Download Arduino IDE

- Visit the [Arduino IDE download page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and download the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for your operating system.

### 2. Connect the Microprocessor

- Connect your Arduino microprocessor (e.g., Arduino Uno) to your computer using a USB cable.

### 3. Open Arduino IDE

- Launch the Arduino IDE that you downloaded in step 1.

### 4. Load Sample Sketch

- Open the Arduino IDE, navigate to `File` > `Examples`, and select a sample sketch to load onto your microprocessor. These sketches are great starting points for various projects.

### 5. Upload to Microprocessor

- Ensure that you've selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE. You can do this by going to `Tools` > `Board` and selecting your Arduino board model and then selecting the appropriate port under `Tools` > `Port`.
- Click the upload button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the sample sketch to your microprocessor.

Now your microprocessor should be running the sample sketch, and you can start building your anti-theft flooring system using Arduino as described in the project documentation.



## Components

To build your anti-theft flooring system using Arduino, you will need the following components:

- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor
- Bluetooth module HC05
- Registers and LEDs
- Piezo sensor
- Jumper wires
- Buzzer
- Power supply (Lithium-ion or appropriate power source)




## Working

An anti-theft flooring system can be created using various components, including an Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, Bluetooth module HC05, registers, LEDs, piezo sensor, jumper wires, buzzer, and a lithium-ion power supply. Here's how the system works:

1. **Ultrasonic Sensor:** The ultrasonic sensor is placed in the flooring and measures the distance between the floor and a person's foot. When someone steps on the sensor, it sends an ultrasonic signal downward and waits for the signal to bounce back. If the time taken for the signal to return is less than a predetermined threshold, it indicates the presence of an object (the person's foot).

2. **Piezo Sensor:** The piezo sensor, also embedded in the flooring, detects pressure or force when someone steps on it. It confirms the presence of a person's foot on the floor.

3. **Arduino Uno:** The Arduino Uno serves as the brain of the system. It receives signals from both the ultrasonic sensor and piezo sensor. When these signals indicate the presence of a person, the Arduino processes this data.

4. **Servo Motor:** Depending on the authorization status, the Arduino controls the servo motor. If authorized, it rotates the servo motor to unlock the door or access point. If unauthorized, it can keep the door locked.

5. **Bluetooth Module HC05:** The HC05 Bluetooth module can be used for remote access control. Users can connect to the system via Bluetooth from a mobile device or other Bluetooth-enabled devices to grant or deny access remotely.

6. **Registers and LEDs:** Registers and LEDs can be used for monitoring and feedback purposes. For instance, LEDs can provide visual indicators of the system's status, and registers can store information or settings.

7. **Buzzer:** The buzzer provides an audible alert in case of unauthorized access, alerting security personnel or building occupants.

8. **Lithium-ion Power Supply:** The lithium-ion power supply provides the necessary power to run the system, ensuring continuous operation.

Overall, this anti-theft flooring system offers an effective and efficient way to prevent unauthorized access, enhance building security, and provide options for remote access control through Bluetooth connectivity.
